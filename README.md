# Monopolio

Monopolio is a game inspired by the famous Monopoly, created in Java by four high school seniors as a group project (Valentino, [Tommaso](https://github.com/TommyPatriarca), [Filippo](https://github.com/mcnardi00), [Giacomo](https://github.com/Suttix56)). This game challenges players to buy and sell cities in Valtellina, a valley located in northern Italy.

This repository was originally intended to be private, but it turned out well, so I decided to make it public. Please disregard the commit names. :)
